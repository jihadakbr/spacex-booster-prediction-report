# SpaceX Booster Prediction Report

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Credit to IBM and the Coursera platform for providing the course materials and guidance.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to assist SpaceY, a new company in the commercial rocket launch industry, to compete with SpaceX. SpaceX currently offers launch services at a starting price of $62 million, which includes some fuel reserved for landing the first stage rocket booster for reuse. By estimating the cost of building the first stage Falcon 9 booster (excluding R&D cost and profit margin) to be upwards of $15 million based on public statements made by SpaceX, the report aims to predict the successful landing of the first stage rocket booster with an 83.3% accuracy level using models based on mission parameters like payload mass and desired orbit. SpaceY intends to leverage these predictions to make informed bids against SpaceX, using them as a proxy for the cost of a launch and enhancing their competitive advantage.
